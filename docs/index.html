    <h2>Model 1:</h2>
    <img src="website/assets/images/image1.png" alt="Model 1">
    <p>In this model, which we are inspired by geometric shapes, all shapes are interconnected. The message we want to convey in this model, which also resembles the skeleton of a building, is that we are much stronger and sturdier when we are together, just like the foundation of a building.</p>
    <ul></ul>

    <h2>Model 2:</h2>
    <img src="website/assets/images/image2.png" alt="Model 2">
    <p>In this model, we were inspired by nature. The sphere in the middle represents the earth, the upward spiral represents the wind, the angular spiral represents the lightning and thunder. In our model, we used green, blue and yellow tones, which are the colors of nature.</p>
    <ul></ul>

    <h2>Model 3:</h2>
    <img src="website/assets/images/image3.png" alt="Model 3">
    <p>This model, inspired by musical instruments, will be enjoyed by music lovers. We used predominantly yellow tones in our model, which evokes wind instruments such as saxophone, trumpet, and tuba.</p>
