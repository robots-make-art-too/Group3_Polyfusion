1. A written document, `PDF` or `.md` file, that contains the following information:
   - a group name, no not just "Group 1" .. make it relevant to the concept you are developing regarding the project, 
      or to the group members (it's _ok_ if there is no final concept yet or if the ideas are general or rough sketches - 
      but this is where doing the reading of the suggested readings becomes relevant.)
   - confirmation that each group member has confirmed their best contact methods and availability

ALL IS WELL HERE...
