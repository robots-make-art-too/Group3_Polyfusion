# Polyfusion

### Documentation is in the Documentation folder. It has videos and some info on the group.
### The Assets folder is for the Prof and the TA's convenience so they dont have to look around for our assets such as Markers and Models.
### Our actual code and assets being used is located through: Group3_Polyfusion/docs/website/pages/marker-based/ar-custom-pattern.html
